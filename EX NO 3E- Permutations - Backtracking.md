# EX 3E Generate Permutations using Backtracking  Approach.
## DATE:
## AIM:
To write a Java program to for given constraints.
Given an array nums of distinct integers, return all the possible Permutation. You can return the answer in any order.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: [[1,2,3],[1,3,2],[2,1,3],[2,3,1],[3,1,2],[3,2,1]]
For example:
## Algorithm
