# EX 3A N Queens Problem - Backtracking Approach.
## DATE:
## AIM:
To Write a Java program for N queens using backtracking approach.
You are given an integer N. For a given N x N chessboard, find a way to place 'N' queens such that no queen can attack any other queen on the chessboard.
A queen can be attacked when it lies in the same row, column, or the same diagonal as any of the other queens. You have to print one such configuration.

Note :

Get the input from the user for N . The value of N must be from 1 to 4

If solution exists Print a binary matrix as output that has 1s for the cells where queens are placed

If there is no solution to the problem  print  "Solution does not exist"
