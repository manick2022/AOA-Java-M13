## DATE:
## AIM:
To write a Java program to for given constraints.
Given an integer array nums, return true if you can partition the array into two subsets such that the sum of the elements in both subsets is equal or false otherwise.
Example 1:
Input: Enter the number of elements: 4
Enter the elements of the array:
1 5 11 5
Output: true
Explanation: The array can be partitioned as [1, 5, 5] and [11].

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 200
1 <= nums[i] <= 100
